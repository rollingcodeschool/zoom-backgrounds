First, we need some tools. 

`brew install youtube-dl` or the equivalent for your OS. 

If you want to use the video from the screenshot above:

`youtube-dl -F 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsN_9a257rM'` 

and then choose the appropriate stream, ie `youtube-dl -f 18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsN_9a257rM'`

_Zoom requires a minimum resolution of 640x360 for virtual backgrounds_ 

Next, go to Zoom preferences and add the video you just downloaded.
